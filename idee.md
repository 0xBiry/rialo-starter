# ðŸ’¡ Idea: Interactive tutorial for DevNet Rialo

Create a small project that demonstrates how to:

- Call an external HTTP API
- Use `.await` or a delay in logic
- Simulate a simple Web2 â†’ Web3 flow
- Use DevNet Rialo step by step

The goal is to allow other beginners to easily test Rialo's native capabilities.

I am willing to write a simple script or document the steps as soon as I have more technical information on DevNet.
